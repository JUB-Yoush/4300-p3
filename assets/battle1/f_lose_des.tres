Description = ""
Outcome = "You’re hit with the news of the enemy Kingdom. They’re approaching steadily, and it’s unclear what their forces are made of. With time not on your side, you won’t be able to build an army by yourself. Having a helping hand is crucial. With little choices, you turn to the army who had fought with you. Only one choice stands before you. The New King, crowned by the Royal Counsel for being the sole survivor of the Raids, praised for their resilience. They’re more calmer than your late soldiers, slow to force but quick to strategize. 

STAMP The new king, the lone survivor (any troop with a crown)"
